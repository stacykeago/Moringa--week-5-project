### The level of financial inclusion in the region encompassing Kenya, Rwanda , Uganda and Tanzania.
You have been tasked with assessing the level of financial inclusion in the region encompassing 
* Kenya
* Rwanda 
* Uganda 
* Tanzania.
## Background to the study:
Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account. Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.

## Define the question
The research problem is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. Your solution will help provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ financial outcomes.

## The metric for success
Main Objective: How mobile money transactions can lead to greater financial inclusion for people who don't have access to banks.Greater financial inclusion leads to greater access to credit services, easier tax base to achieve revenues, better access to savings and fintech services.
Specific Objectives: -To determine the number of people who have access to mobile phones and don't have access to the banks -To determine the percentage of level of access to mobile phones for people in the region. -To determine the percentage of level of access to mobile phones for people in urban areas and rural areas -To determine the percentage of level of access to mobile phones for people in the region per country . -To determine the number of people with access to bank accounts and how this varies in urban and rural areas, variance between the formally employed and self-employed. -To determine the country with the most mobile phones and the highest number of bank accounts. -To determine the influence of mobile phone access to and location to job type. -To determine the people to be targeted with mobile banking integration. -To determine the job type to be targeted with fintech marketing in the region for people with a phone but no bank account -To determine which age has the most access to mobile phones Age with mobile phone but no bank account, highestAge with mobile phone and bank account.

## The experimental design taken:
1. Import the libraries.
2. Upload the datasets
3. Preview the data, read and explore the given dataset
The main dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by individuals across East Africa. This data was extracted from various Finscope surveys ranging from 2016 to 2018, and more information about these surveys can be found here: Dataset Files: Variable Definitions: http://bit.ly/VariableDefinitions [( http://bit.ly/VariableDefinitions)] Dataset: [(http://bit.ly/FinancialDataset)].

4. Data cleaning:
-Accessing dataset information :check columns, data shape -Drop the Unique id, Find and deal with null/missing values, Check and align column data types, Find and deal with outliers, Find and deal with Anomalies

5. Univariate Analysis
Mode, Median, mean, interquartile range, the standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis, histogram, bar chart, box plot, frequency table, Recommendations

6. Bivariate
-scatter plots -line charts to determine the relationship between variables, describing the relationship between two quantitative variables, computing and interpreting the Pearson correlation coefficient. Provide recommendations for effectively performing bivariate analysis while working on the current problem.

7. Multivariate analysis
-Factor analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis -finding relationships between variables using multiple regression analysis -applying reduction techniques to the analysis. -provide recommendations for effectively performing univariate analysis. -recommendations for effectively performing multivariate analysis while working on the current problem.
